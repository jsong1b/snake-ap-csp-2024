# ncurses-snake

Snake written in Python using the curses module. My Create Performance Task for the 2024 AP Computer Science Principles.

## The Video

The plan for the video is:
1. Run `./snake.py 70 25` in a full screen terminal in the workspace.
   * Showcase how the game works, get around 2 fruit.
   * Stay on the game over screen for a couple of seconds.
2. Run `./snake.py 0 50` to show what happens when a value less than 10 is passed.
3. Run `./snake.py 1000 1000` to show what happens when a value more than the screen size is passed.
4. Run `./snake.py` to show what happens when no command line arguments are passed into the program.
